# python-api-challenge

## Background
The goal of this project is to utilize Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" We already have a sense that temperature will have a tendency to increase, but how can we use data to prove this or gather additional insights alongside this?
